###### a) A brief description of the project. Here, Iâ€™m looking for a short description: probably 1 sentence, 2-3 at most.
The project is a flash card simulator for studying.  It can create, cards and help to learn new material.

b) As a user I can create cards with custom input so that I can enter questions and answers.  As a user i can shuffle the deck, flip cards to the front and back, view the next card in the deck, save decks of cars to the loader so that I can study efficiently.

c) The software does run, but has problems with sound.  When it opens there are buttons to flip the card over, go to the next card, create a new card, go to the main menue and save.

d) As a user I can add a better gui for a more enjoyable study experence so that more studying can get done.  As a user I can add cross platform capability so that more users can have access to it.  As a user I can add touch screen capability to it for modern divices.

e) The readme could be more descriptive of the program.  It may be because the program does not have much to it, but I belive there is more to this program then the readme says.

f) ant is well maintained and has little to no work that needs to be done for it, bellow is what's available:
clean    Removes the build, javadoc, dist, and temp directories
compile  Compiles the project
jar      Makes a jar file that runs this project
javadoc  Compiles the javadoc and publishes it to a github page
run      Runs the project through the main method in FlashCardApplication
test     Runs the JUnitTests in the Test classes 

g) There are a good amount of issues like being unable to launch with sound.  In addion, there are many features that could be added like the mute button.  There should be enough work to earn 1000 points, and the expectaions are clear.

h) There are many features that can be added to enhance the program like a better gui, cross platform capability, and adding sound that actually works.

i) The classes are named well, and their purposes are to modify: the Deck, Flash card, and Quiz.  They have started on the sound controller as the next classes to implement.  Some of the code is written and commented legibly, other parts need some improvment.
